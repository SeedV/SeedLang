# SeedBlock and SeedX Grammars

## SeedBlock

The syntax of SeedBlock is defined by an ANTLR v4 grammar file named
[SeedBlock.g4](/grammars/SeedBlock.g4). The parser generated by the ANTLR tool
is used to parse the whole SeedBlock program or validate the partial user input
during inline editing.

The SeedBlock program is serialized into the memory with the JSON Block Exchange
Format, which includes the information of the blocks UI and the parsing tree.
It's the main storage format of SeedBlock and can be shared with other users. A
Visitor is used to walk through the parse tree to translate the SeedBlock
program into SeedAST.

## SeedX Languages

The syntax of SeedX languages is defined by the ANTLR v4 grammar files located
in the `grammars` directory. The parser and visitor generated by the ANTLR tool
are used to walk through the parse tree to translate the SeedX program into
SeedAST.

- SeedPython: The syntax of SeedPython is defined in
  [SeedPython.g4](/grammars/SeedPython.g4), which is a subset of the
  [ANTLR v4 Python3 grammar](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/python/python3-py/Python3.g4).
